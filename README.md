# convolution-image-oparation

This is a project that was assigned as an exercise from the university. The purpose of the exercise was to learn how to use multiple cores of an embedded device in order to calculate faster some calculations. The calculation that is being executed in this exercise is a convolution operation. The exercise consists of two parts. The first part uses the two cores as said above, to calculate a random image that, we assume, all its pixels are random. The second part uses the two cores and also the interrupts of the private timer in the **ARM-Cortex** processing system of the **zybo z7** development board in order to simulate a real-time system that takes random images from an input every a fixed time.
